# Privacy Policy for Chiota
Effective date: June 03, 2018

# About Chiota
Chiota is an [open source Chat App](https://github.com/Noc2/Chiota), which uses the IOTA tangle and your smartphone storage to store your encrypted information and messages. In addition to that your user image will be stored in my blob storage account (since it’s really slow to upload an image to the tangle). 
The only information I have access to is your uploaded user image. You can use Chiota without a user image!

**Warning**: Chiota is still in an early alpha status. In addition, you probably will lose all your contacts with the next IOTA snapshot. It’s not recommended to use any IOTA seed, which stores any valuable information or money. Furthermore, I cannot guarantee the security of the encryption or any other part of the app.

# Personal information Chiota needs accesses to: 
- Name 
- Documents (device folders and files) 
- Camera 

# Why is the data processing necessary?
Your name or username is used as your chat contact name. Access to documents is used to upload a user image and the camera is used for scanning the QR Codes. 

# Does Chiota disclose any information to outside parties? 
No!

# How can I delete my data?
All information stored on your device will be deleted if you delete the app. 
The encrypted information you upload to the tangle is currently stored on the tangle until the next snapshot. Since I don’t have any access to this data and it’s stored and uploaded by you, I can not delete this information. 
If you want me to delete your user image on my blob storage, just write me an email.
